# ðŸ§  Tik-Tac-Toe-Reinforcement-Learner

This project implements a **reinforcement learning (RL) agent** that learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe using a **Monte Carlo control approach with Q-learning updates**.
The agent improves through **self-play vs a random opponent**, updating its Q-table after each episode.

---

## ðŸ“– Approach

* State representation: **board encoded as tuple of tuples**
* Action selection: **epsilon-greedy policy**
* Update rule:

```python
# Monte Carlo Q-update
Q[s][a] = Q[s][a] + alpha * (G_t - Q[s][a])
```

where `G_t` is the discounted return from step `t`.

* Rewards:

  * `+1` â†’ win
  * `-1` â†’ loss
  * `0.3` â†’ draw
  * `0` â†’ non-terminal moves

The AI starts with random moves, but over time develops a strategy that wins consistently against a random opponent and can also challenge human players.
